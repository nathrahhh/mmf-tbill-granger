# Money Market Fund Maturities and Short-Term Interest Rates: A Granger Causality Analysis

## 📘 Overview

This repository accompanies my MSc Investment Management thesis titled
**“Money Market Fund Maturities and Short-Term Interest Rates: New Evidence from Granger Causality Tests”**
submitted to Bayes Business School (City, University of London) in 2025 under the supervision of **Dr. Sotiris Staikouras**.

The study investigates whether **money market fund (MMF) portfolio maturities** and **U.S. Treasury bill yields** exhibit predictive relationships over time. Building on Domian (1992), it revisits the causality structure using **modern SEC N-MFP data** and **updated econometric methods**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Determine whether MMF maturities Granger-cause Treasury bill yields, or vice versa.
* Examine how this relationship evolved under changing **monetary policy regimes** and **regulatory reforms** (2010, 2016, 2024).
* Provide an empirical comparison between historical and modern MMF behavior using **robust time-series tests** and **visual analysis**.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**

   * Extracted `<averagePortfolioMaturity>` and related variables from SEC Form N-MFP filings (June 2016 – June 2025).
   * Aggregated across three representative MMFs: Fidelity Hereford Street Trust, JPMorgan Prime MMF, and Goldman Sachs Trust.
   * Maturity data was weighted by total net assets to form a composite index.
   * Treasury bill data sourced from **FRED (3-month T-bill yield, DGS3MO)** and aggregated to monthly frequency.

2. **Data Transformation**

   * Conducted **Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF)** tests for stationarity.
   * Applied **first differencing**, **log transformations**, and **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**–based lag selection.

3. **Causality Testing**

   * Estimated **bivariate autoregressive models** (VAR) for MMF maturity and T-bill yields.
   * Applied **Granger causality tests** to detect predictive relationships in both directions.

4. **Interpretation**

   * Results showed **no evidence of Granger causality** in either direction, diverging from Domian (1992).
   * Possible explanations include post-crisis monetary regimes, fund reclassification, and data frequency differences.

## 📊 Key Tools and Libraries

* `pandas`, `numpy` — data management
* `statsmodels` — econometric testing
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — visualization
* `lxml`, `xml.etree` — XML parsing
* `requests` — SEC data retrieval

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

* **Subsample or rolling-window Granger tests** to detect time-varying causality (Alam et al., 2021).
* **Multivariate VAR models** incorporating policy stance (EFFR), volatility (VIX), or MMF sector size (AUM).
* **Higher-frequency data** to improve lag precision and dynamic analysis.
